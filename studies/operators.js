/*
* OPERATORS:
*   
*   0. In Javascript, an operator is a symbols that performs an operation.
*   
*   1. The value or variable on either side of an operator is called an operand.
*
*   2. The main kinds of operators are: 
*    Assignment operators
*    Arithmetic operators
*    Comparison operators
*    Logical operators
*    Unary operators
*    Ternary operators

        /* Arithmetic operators work the same way that they do in math.
        * The four arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-),
        * multiplication (*), and division (/). You can use them to do math problems
        * or even add or subtract from strings or other variables.
