/*
* LOOPS:
* 
* 0. Loops perform or utter an action repeatedly.
*
* 1. They're important so we can perform an action a specific number of times.
*
* 2. There are three main kinds of loops:
*   - While loops
*   - For loops
*   - For in loops
* 
* 3. For and while loops all have startng an stopping conditions.
*
* 4. Starting conditions tell your code when to start executing.
* 
* 5. Stopping conditions tell your code when to stop.
*
* 6. Make sure to properly set your stopping condition or your code may never stop running!
